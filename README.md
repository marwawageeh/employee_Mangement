# 👩‍💼 Employee Mangement System – Python Project (2023)

This is a personal project I developed in 2023 during my second year at university.  
The project is a simple yet powerful **Employee Registration System** built using Python.  
It includes all the basic functionalities needed to manage employee data.

## 💡 Project Description

The system allows the user to:

1. **Add new employees**
2. **Edit existing employee information**
3. **Delete employee records**
4. **View all employee data**

It was one of my favorite projects because I learned so many important programming concepts through it — especially related to data handling, functions, and logic building.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python
- No external libraries used — built entirely with standard Python

## ✨ Features

- Command-line based interface
- Easy to navigate and use
- CRUD operations:
  - **C**reate (Add employee)
  - **R**ead (View all employees)
  - **U**pdate (Edit employee data)
  - **D**elete (Remove employee)
- Clean and organized code structure
- Designed for learning and understanding core Python concepts


## 📝 Notes

- This project is educational and was part of my personal learning journey.
- It can be further enhanced by integrating with a database or building a simple GUI using Tkinter or web frameworks.
